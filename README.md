# CRUMBS
A robust, simple and easy to use GPS data logger. And basic software tools to
use the collected data.

The first goal of the project is to create ~20 "stage 2" devices that
are ready for use in April 2017.

[Hardware](https://github.com/wildtreetech/CRUMBS/blob/master/hardware.md) | [Firmware](https://github.com/wildtreetech/CRUMBS/blob/master/software.md) | [Server](https://github.com/wildtreetech/CRUMBS/tree/master/server)

# Use cases

Potential use cases are infinite, this is a shorter list where we
know of a potential user:

* backup GPS logger for a motorbike based survey of rural areas
* data collection after a natural disaster to produce road maps
* real time fleet tracking by text message

# Licensing
The default license is BSD-3. This is usually applied to software, so do we need
to pick a hardware license that fits the BSD-3 philosophy?
