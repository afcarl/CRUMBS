# Software

The ESP8266 can run MicroPython. This makes for fast prototyping and
allows anyone who knows python to contribute.

We need a slick setup to create our own images and flash them onto the
device. As few manual steps as possible.

This device is the backup device for the trip, so less features and simpler
code in exchange for robustness is a good trade off.

Start with something that records the GPS location, operates reliably, and
does not require human intervention. Connect power -> just works.
